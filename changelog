05.03.19 v1.2:
	* Script now accepts additional arguments as arguments for the application
		executable. For example, for launching the game with -opengl -nodx
		arguments launch the script with the same arguments:
		./start.sh -opengl -nodx
	* Added the ability to use winetricks in tools.sh script
	* Added the ability to use winetricks for installing components and
		applying tweaks during prefix creation. Add components/tweaks names
		into game_info/winetricks_list.txt file and winetricks will automatically
		install them. Winetricks itself will be downloaded by script automatically
		if it's not installed.
		More info in game_info/readme_en.txt file.
	* Script now uses XDG_CACHE_HOME directory for storing cache directory
		near itself. This directory is used for storing fonts caches, shader
		caches, etc. And it's also used for
		files that winetricks downloads.
	* Cache and log files of DXVK now stores in cache/dxvk directory.
	* Most variable from settings_SCRIPTNAME file are renamed to be more
		meaningful.
	* Script now output more useful information during prefix creation
		and hides useless information.
	* Script output redirection to different file is not removed as it
		breaks some games (For example, The Sims 4)
	* Resolution restoration is now correctly works with multi-monitor
		configurations (thanks to guys from RuTracker).
	* Using of game_info/additional directory is changed and simplified.
		It now uses directories that match the real one.
		More info in game_info/readme_en.txt file.
	* File descriptors limit is not rises to 500k when ESYNC is enabled.
		Because the old 100k isn't enough for some games.
	* GLIBC version checking is added back.
	* Documentation updated.
	* Some additional fixes and impovements.
